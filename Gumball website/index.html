                         The Amazing World of Gumball is a British-American animated sitcom created by Ben Bocquelet for Cartoon Network.
                   The series concerns the lives of 12-year-old Gumball Watterson, an anthropomorphic blue cat, and adoptive goldfish brother Darwin, who attend middle school in the fictional city of Elmore, California. 
                   They often find themselves in various shenanigans around the city, during which they interact with fellow family members younger sister Anais, mother Nicole, and father Richard along with an extended supporting cast of characters.
                  The Amazing World of Gumball is a British-American animated sitcom created by Ben Bocquelet for Cartoon Network.

They often find themselves in various shenanigans around the city, during which they interact with fellow family members younger sister Anais, mother Nicole, and father Richard along with an extended supporting cast of characters.
                  Bocquelet based several of the series' characters on rejected characters from his previous commercial work while making its premise a mixture of "family shows and school shows", which Cartoon Network was heavily interested in.
                  After Bocquelet pitched The Amazing World of Gumball to the network, Turner Broadcasting executive Daniel Lennard green-lit the production of the series. The show was produced by Cartoon Network Studios Europe, in association with Boulder Media (Ireland; season 1) and Studio Soi.

                  Gumball is noted for its intentional stylistic disunity, with characters designed, filmed, and animated using various styles and techniques, oftentimes within the same scene (stylized traditional animation, puppetry, CGI, stop motion, Flash animation, live-action, etc.).
                  The series has received critical acclaim and developed a cult following, with particular praises for its extensive references to popular culture and internet culture, sarcasm, subtle innuendos, dark humor, and metahumor.
                  Although it is a children's series, Gumball comments on topics that are often considered serious or mature, including philosophy, marriage, cyberbullying, political intolerance, mental illness, and the human condition.

                  On September 6, 2016, Bocquelet announced the series would end after season 6; he reaffirmed his position on Twitter in October 2018.
                  However, Turner Northern Europe was unable to confirm the sixth season to be the show's last, which could make way for future episodes.
                   Following the series finale, two miniseries were released: the six-episode Darwin's Yearbook in November 2019 and The Gumball Chronicles in October 2020.
                   On February 17, 2021, Cartoon Network revealed that a television film based on the series was in development.
                   On September 21, 2021, it was announced that a new spin-off series, to be a follow-up for both the show and the movie, had been greenlit for Cartoon Network and HBO Max alongside the film.
                   On August 22, 2022, it was reported that the film would no longer be heading to HBO Max, but would be shopped to other outlets instead.

                  The series revolves around the life of a 12-year-old cat named Gumball Watterson and his frequent shenanigans in the fictional American city of Elmore, accompanied by his adopted goldfish brother and best friend Darwin. 
                  Gumball's other family members his intellectual sister Anais and stay-at-home father Richard, both rabbits, and workaholic mother Nicole, a cat often find themselves involved in Gumball's exploits. 
                  Gumball attends school with his siblings at Elmore Junior High, where throughout the series he interacts with his various middle school classmates, most prominently his love interest Penny Fitzgerald.

                  One prominent feature of the series since its third season is "The Void", a dimension inside of Elmore where all the universe's mistakes reside. 
                  This includes references to aspects of reality as well as in-series elements. 
                  Rob is a background character from the first two seasons who became trapped in The Void after becoming "irrelevant". 
                  He later escapes in Season 3, after which he becomes Gumball's nemesis and main antagonist. 
                  He is shown to be aware of his fictional existence in the Season 4 episode "The Disaster", and his hatred towards Gumball is a result of his role as the protagonist.

            <p>Early concept
              Originally, Gumball was meant to be a blue dog. 
              Not much thought was put into this choice as it was more of a placeholder than a final design. 
              As the creators developed the character further, they decided to make him a black cat, as it fit the personality they had in mind for him: unlucky, but optimistic (black cats symbolize bad luck in European culture). 
              The creators found this trait to be too restricting in terms of possible plots and stories. 
              In addition, a silhouette cat would be "hard to read" on the backgrounds planned for the show.
              
              The decision was finally reached to have him blue, a decision that the show creator Ben Bocquelet liked, because he thought blue was not a color usually found on cats, and it had a "70's-80's Japanese mascot" sort of feel.

                    Anais Errrrrr Watterson, a pink rabbit, is Gumball's precocious 4-year-old sister.
                    She is one grade above her brothers. 
                    She is always telling Gumball what to do.
                     She often impatiently tags along with him as a voice of reason.
                      She has, however, been shown manipulating her family to get what she wants. 
                      She sometimes exhibits childlike behavior.
                       Anais is shown as socially-inept and incapable of forming friendships as she drives potential friends away with over-the-top clinginess.
                 </p>
                 
                 <p>Infancy
                 As shown in "The Rival," Anais was like every innocent, new-born baby, but when she was put alone with Gumball and Darwin, she became dangerous, and was able to outsmart everyone and got away with tormenting her brothers. She eventually made peace with her brothers after Gumball saved her life, but she continued to blame them for things she had done. Throughout the years, she matured and discontinued this behaviour.
                 </p> <p>
                 Intelligence
                 Anais is by far the most intelligent member of her family, although her young age prevents her from really being noticed and taken seriously by adults. She is rather mature and rational in the way she acts and speaks. She has been shown on numerous occasions to have a knack for solving problems, such as when she figured a way out of the house when it was flooded in "The Responsible," and the time she developed a complex solution to solve the problem of getting her grandmother's luggage up a flight of stairs in "The Kiss." Even though Anais is four years old, she attends Elmore Junior High because of her extremely high IQ; however, she is not in the same class as her brothers and instead goes to an eighth-grade class located elsewhere in the school. Anais is also a valued member of the school's Physics Club, and her vast knowledge of the subject has saved her from being vaporized by Bobert in his combat form in "The Club."
                 </p><p>
                 As shown in "The Remote" and in "The World," Anais knows how to sew, as she sewed up a hole in Daisy, and also sewed a zipper into Daisy.
                 </p> <p>
                 Anais is a remarkably cunning strategist as well, as revealed in the episodes "The Remote" and "The Password," plotting elaborate schemes, and decoying everybody's perceptions to achieve her goal, though she is often underestimated due to her significantly young age, which she tends to use to her advantage.
                 </p> <p>
                 Sometimes she is respected for her intelligence like in the episode "The Password," when Gumball says "clever girl" after finding out about Anais' plan to hog the computer all to herself by once again by driving the Watterson family out of the house, similar to the episode "The Remote."
                 </p> <p>
                 Her intelligence plays an important part on preventing the copycat family from imitating her family in the near climax of "The Copycats", when she realize the copycats do not have her doppelgänger.
                 </p> <p>
                 Maturity
                 Anais can also be considered the most mature member of her family, aside from her mother. She often takes care of her brothers in many ways, like helping them with their homework, and making their breakfast, as said in "The Responsible." Due to her young age, however, she is prone to occasionally acting childish and still has stuffed animals.
                 </p> <p> 
                 Temper
                 Anais has shown some signs of having her mother's fiery temper. She is often very rude and condescending towards her brother, Gumball, calling him a “slack-jawed, pea-brained dimwit” because she thought on impulse it was Gumball’s fault Darwin was sneezing. When her brother accidentally lost her doll, she was extremely upset and demanding, threatening to tell their mother what had happened. On another occasion, after finally taking Granny Jojo's bags upstairs, when asked to bring them down, she instead grew furious and kicked her suitcase out the window. Also, in "The Vacation," Richard hugged her to protect her, and she violently attacked him, thinking he was a monster. In "The Pest," Gumball and Darwin awoke from their sleep and found Anais violently and mercilessly attacking her stuffed animals because she was angry at Billy for bullying her at school, and even wanted to beat him up, showing that she can be just as angry and violent as her mother.

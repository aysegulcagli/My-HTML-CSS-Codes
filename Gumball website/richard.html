                    Richard Buckley Watterson is a 38-year-old anthropomorphic pink rabbit.
                     He is the father of Gumball, Darwin and Anais.
                      A stay-at-home dad, he spends most of his time sleeping, watching TV, and playing video games. 
                      Richard sometimes dresses as a woman, calling himself Samantha. 
                      He is "the laziest person in Elmore".
                      He has a large appetite and is a voracious eater. 
                      Richard often serves as a third wheel to his sons' misadventures and cares deeply for his family despite his lethargy.
                       He is naive and frequently gets called "dumb".

                    Richard is shown exhibiting childish behavior. 
                    He believes in ghosts and Santa Claus.
                     He enjoys pulling pranks and laughing at people, but hates it when others prank or laugh at him.
                 </p>
              <p>  Even though he is unemployed, Richard is almost always seen wearing a work uniform, which consists of a long-sleeved, buttoned-up white polo shirt, light brown pants, and a dark grey clip-on tie. His lower torso is big enough to cast a shadow on the upper area of his leg. As his wife and son do, Richard goes around barefoot, although when he is in his sleepwear, he wears brown slippers, along with a brown sleep robe. He occasionally wears light blue pajamas.
</p>  <p>
In season 2, his appearance changes slightly. The shadow under his belly becomes much lighter, his eyes and overall body become a little rounder, and like Anais, his ears are shorter than they were in season 1. While the sleeves on his shirt usually appeared rolled, up, they now fully cover his arms.
</p> <p>


Also, his tongue was changed from red to light pink, and the inside of his mouth is pink as well, like his son, Gumball. He is a slightly lighter pink than the last season, and his lower teeth are shown when he is talking, whereas in Season 1 his lower teeth were only shown when he yells.
</p> <p>
From season 3 to now, Richard's eyes are permanently round like the rest of his family. However, he can sometimes be seen with his old oval eyes. In "The Kids," it is revealed that Richard has ice blue eyes.
</p> <p>
As a young adult, Richard wore an outfit based on the grunge fashion of the 1990s. This outfit consists of a red-and-black plaid shirt with white sleeves, a black t-shirt with a yellow smiley face on it (referencing the Nirvana smiley face T-shirt), and ripped blue-gray jeans. He also had stubble on his upper lip and chin.
</p> <p>
As seen in "The Choices," in his early adolescence, Richard had freckles, and wore a yellow jacket over a green sweatshirt, with blue jeans and a red and white hat with a blue heart on the front. During what was likely his middle school years, he wore a backward red-and-black baseball cap, a white T-shirt with the word "SK8" printed in red over a black design, a black long-sleeved undershirt, woodland camouflage pants, and black-and-white sneakers. He also had braces and had begun to develop stubble.
</p> <p>


In his later teenage years, as also seen in "The Choices" and in "The Cycle," he had acne and, like his early adult self, black stubble on his chin and upper lip, albeit a bit messier. His outfit is basically a restyle of the outfit he would wear in his early adult years. He wore a black t-shirt with what resembles the Snaggletooth logo from the metal band Mot√∂rhead. His blue jeans were less ripped, and the red flannel shirt was tied around his waist. He also wore a gold earring in his right ear.

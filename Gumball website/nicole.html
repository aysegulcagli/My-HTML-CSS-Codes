                    Doctor Nicole Watterson (voiced by Teresa Gallagher) is a 38-year-old  cat and the mother of Gumball, Darwin, and Anais. 
                    She is a bossy, over-stressed, hot-tempered workaholic, who can be sweet. 
                    Nicole is a master martial artist, knowing Karate and winning numerous tournaments when she was young. 
                    She shows affection for and is protective of her family. Nicole is occasionally vindictive, while also resourceful and inventive. 
                    In "The Parents", it is revealed that Doctor is her first name and Nicole is her middle name.
                 </p>
                 <p>Nicole greatly resembles her oldest son Gumball, who is, like her, a cat. She has light blue fur and is somewhere between Gumball and Richard in height. Her head is shaped similarly to Gumball's, except with shorter whiskers, her nose is pink, and she has visible eyelashes. The inside of her mouth is light pink, her tongue is pink, and she has two fangs that are not always shown.
</p>
<p>Her usual outfit consists of a white collared shirt with an orange, yellow, and green striped button that symbolizes her workplace, the Rainbow Factory, and a short, light gray skirt. Like Gumball and Richard, she is usually barefoot.
</p>
<p>In her season 2 redesign, her shirt is tucked in, her body has gotten much slimmer, and she has wide hips, similar to Gumball's. Her mouth and head are rounder, the shadows from her shirt and skirt have disappeared, and her whiskers have gotten shorter. As with all of the Wattersons, her eyes are oval-shaped.
</p>
<p>From season 3 onward, Nicole's eyes are permanently round, along with the rest of her family.
</p>
<p>When Gumball was a toddler, Nicole, like her husband Richard, wore fashion that seems to date from the 1990s. This outfit was made up of a pink over-sized off-the-shoulder sweater, a black belt with a gold buckle, and white jeans.
</p>
<p>In "The Choices," where she was seen in her early adolescence, she wore a white keikogi with a red belt, since she was on her way to a karate tournament. Back in season 1, she is shown wearing a white and red sweater with a number one on the front, a pink skirt, and a red hair bow on her head.
</p>
<p> her late teenage years, as also seen in "The Choices," she wore a blue jacket over a white collared shirt, a purple skirt over black leggings, and purple and white sneakers, and she had a short bob style haircut, with her bangs pinned back with a pink hair clip.
</p>
<p>In a flashback from "The Ape," she was seen at prom with a permed hairstyle, and she wore a short pink dress with the skirt having three frilly layers.

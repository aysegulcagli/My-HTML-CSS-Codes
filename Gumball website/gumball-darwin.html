                   Gumball Tristopher "Trisha" Watterson born Zach Watterson, is the protagonist.
                   He is a 12-year-old mischievous blue cat who lives with his family. He attends middle school.
                   In "The Club", his middle name was supposed to be Christopher, but it was actually Tristopher or Trisha for short. 
                   In "The Name", he changed his name into Zach and later changed it back into Gumball.

                  Gumball was initially presented as well-meaning, but naive. 
                  Later, he was shown as more serious, capable of logical thinking, and prone to sarcasm. 
                  Despite occasional lapses in judgment, Gumball is loyal, straightforward, and good-natured. 
                  He is protective of his loved ones but has a large ego, often causing him to overreact.
                 </p>
                 <p>In general, Gumball is very protective of his loved ones. On multiple occasions, he is quick to go into a sort of "over-protective" mode whenever anybody tries to hurt his siblings, Darwin and Anais, as seen in "The Parasite," in which he tried to nearly poison Jodie when he thought she was hurting Anais, or in "The Rerun," in which he aimlessly tried to attack Rob out of rage when Darwin died.
</p> <p> 
Gumball has a very sarcastic nature. He is quick to diffuse all sorts of quips towards others, ranging from fairly harmless to sometimes blunt and rude. As demonstrated in episodes such as "The Stories" and "The Test," these snarky comments are impulsive.
</p> <p>
Gumball also has a fairly massive ego, which seems to be a fault of his. When not tamed properly, his ego can drive him to do some pretty jerky things. Darwin tapping into his musical talents in "The Triangle" causes Gumball to have short-lived jealousy towards him before he realizes he is wrong. His ego also explains his relationship with Alan; the fact that Alan is so effortlessly loved drives Gumball to expose him for being scummier than he lets on (which later turns out to be accurate). This ego also makes him very sensitive, as seen in "The Meddler," in which he becomes an emotional wreck when he is told his cheerleading performance was terrible.

                  Darwin Raglan Caspian Ahab Poseidon Nicodemius Watterson, III is a 10-year-old orange goldfish who was adopted by the Watterson family.
                   Initially given to Gumball as a pet, Darwin later sprouted legs and became a full family member.
                    His arc begins with him as a naif, then shows him maturing.
                     Darwin is loyal to Gumball and helps him out. 
                     He is sometimes shown exhibiting strange behavior, such as calling his adoptive parents Mr Dad and Mrs Mom. 
                     In "The Party", it is revealed that this is Darwin's full name.
                    </p>
                  <p> Darwin is a very happy and positive person. He is optimistic, always trying to see the best in most of the scenarios he is in, and in general, always tries to have a smile on his face. Not only does he desire to be happy, but he also desires to see others happy. His selfless acts of happiness can be seen in episodes such as "The Fan," "The Advice," and "The Stories." In all three episodes, he chooses to do the things he does in order to make a particular sad person happier.
</p>  <p>
                    Darwin is also a very grateful person. As seen in "The Flower" and "The Night," Darwin is shown not wanting much and just being happy with his current life.
           </p>   <p>     
                    Darwin expects the best in people, and his optimism extends to a romantic and somewhat na√Øve view on the world. His idealistic viewpoints can be seen in "The Wicked" in which, despite his brother's views and Mrs. Robinson's obvious malicious intent, he firmly believes that Mrs. Robinson is a good person at heart, and that there is a reason for her actions.
               </p>   <p> 
                    Darwin has a strong sense of honesty; he also desires to tell the truth, no matter how much trouble it may cause. His strong sense of honesty can be seen in "The Shell" and "The Gift," in which he cannot adhere to the simplest of Gumball's white lies. His honesty, however, is prevailed by his politeness towards others; in "The Words," Gumball encourages him to bluntly suggest his opinions towards students.
                   </p>    <p>
                    Darwin is also morally grounded in general; he is typically the one to stop his siblings from doing anything wrong, and he is slow to take "shady" approaches. Darwin's reluctance to do anything wrong can be seen in "The DVD," in which he tells Gumball not to pirate Alligators on a Train, opting for a more honest and cleaner route. This trait of Darwin is what causes Gumball to see him as a "moral guardian" as evidenced in "The Sidekick."
                   </p>  <p>
                    Darwin is also very sensitive and empathetic. He is very affectionate of others, as seen in his interactions with his family, and specifically Gumball, throughout the series. This love and affection may be a weakness of his; however, as a result, he is very possessive without his loved ones, and feels very lonely when not around them. Such is evidenced in "The Bros" and "The Burden," in which Penny's newfound relationship with Gumball makes him jealous (presumably for the first time in his life, as suggested by the events of "The Flower").

            <p>Gumball is a very imaginative person. 
              Despite his mediocre academic performance, he can be surprisingly brilliant when it comes to formulating all sorts of mischievous schemes.
               This side of him can be seen in episodes such as "The Plan," in which he quickly formulates a basic outline to he and his siblings plan to "save" their mother, and in "The Scam," in which he forms a crafty scheme that will allow him to cleanly heist the town's candy effortlessly. 
               Such a side may also suggest Gumball is smarter than he lets on, as hinted by his expansive vocabulary, cooking skills, and ukulele skills as well.

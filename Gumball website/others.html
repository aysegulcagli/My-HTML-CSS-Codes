                    Joseph "Banana Joe" A. Banana (voiced by Mic Graves) is a hyperactive banana and the class clown, who cracks a joke whenever possible.
                   He can be a bully, usually to Gumball and Darwin.

                    Penny Fitzgerald (voiced by Teresa Gallagher) is a shape-shifting fairy (formerly a peanut with antlers) and classmate of Gumball who belatedly becomes his girlfriend. 
                    Like Gumball, she has trouble expressing her feelings.
                     Underneath Penny's shell lies a yellow, fairy-like self that shape-shifts based on her emotional state.
                      She is a member of the Elmore Junior High cheerleading and synchronized swimming teams.

                    Tobias Wilson (voiced by Rupert Degas, season 1; Hugo Harrison, season 2 onward) is a multicolored, cloud-shaped humanoid who is interested in sports and possesses an overbearing self-confidence.
                     He thinks of himself as a heavily built jock, despite actually being rather weak, and appears to be wealthy.
                    He debuts in "The Third", where he demands twenty dollars to be Gumball and Darwin's friend.

                    Carrie Krueger is a supporting character in The Amazing World of Gumball. She is a ghost who is in Miss Simian's class at Elmore Junior High. Her first appearance was a cameo in "The Third" and her first major appearance was in "The Ghost." It is revealed in "The Mirror," that a man named the Snatcher (formerly known as Vladus Lokowitchki) is her father. As of "The Matchmaker," Carrie is dating Darwin.
                 </p>

                <p> In season 1, Carrie is a white, translucent ghost with a ghostly tail in place of her legs and a hairclip that resembles a skull with wings. Her arms rest in front of her body and her hair covers her left eye, though sometimes it will swing over to her right. She also has magenta and cyan lining around her, making her seem like a 3D anaglyph image. When her teeth are visible, they are shown to be sharp and pointed. She normally has black eyebrows.
</p> <p>
In season 2, Carrie's appearance is slightly changed due to the change in the show's animation style. Her head becomes slightly more rectangular, and she now has a shoulder on each side of her body, which her arms now hang from. She also becomes a darker color, and her outline gets thicker, like the other 2D characters on the show with outlines.
